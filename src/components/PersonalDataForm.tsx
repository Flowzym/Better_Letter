The script is missing a closing curly brace `}` at the end. Here's the fixed version with the closing brace added:

```typescript
// ... [rest of the code remains the same]

    </div>
  );
}
```

The issue was that the component definition needed one more closing curly brace to properly close the `PersonalDataForm` component. The rest of the code appears to be properly structured with matching brackets and parentheses.
